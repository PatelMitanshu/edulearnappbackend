# Data Isolation Fix Summary

## Problem
All teachers could see students and standards created by other teachers, which caused data privacy issues.

## Solution
Implemented proper data isolation by filtering all database queries to only return data created by the authenticated teacher.

## Changes Made

### 1. Student Routes (`/backend/routes/students.js`)
- **GET /api/students**: Added `createdBy: req.teacher._id` filter
- **GET /api/students/by-standard/:standardId**: Added `createdBy: req.teacher._id` filter  
- **GET /api/students/:id**: Changed to use `findOne` with `createdBy` filter
- **PUT /api/students/:id**: Added `createdBy` filter for student lookup
- **DELETE /api/students/:id**: Added `createdBy` filter for student lookup
- **POST /api/students**: Updated roll number uniqueness check to be scoped to teacher

### 2. Standard Routes (`/backend/routes/standards.js`)
- **GET /api/standards**: Added `createdBy: req.teacher._id` filter
- **GET /api/standards/:id**: Changed to use `findOne` with `createdBy` filter
- **PUT /api/standards/:id**: Added `createdBy` filter for standard lookup
- **DELETE /api/standards/:id**: Added `createdBy` filter for standard lookup
- **POST /api/standards**: Updated existence check to be scoped to teacher

### 3. Upload Routes (`/backend/routes/uploads.js`)
- **GET /api/uploads/student/:studentId**: Added teacher verification and `uploadedBy` filter
- **GET /api/uploads/:id**: Added `uploadedBy: req.teacher._id` filter
- **PUT /api/uploads/:id**: Added `uploadedBy` filter for upload lookup
- **DELETE /api/uploads/:id**: Added `uploadedBy` filter for upload lookup
- **POST /api/uploads**: Added student ownership verification

### 4. Database Schema Updates

#### Student Model (`/backend/models/Student.js`)
- Updated compound index to include `createdBy` field:
  ```javascript
  studentSchema.index({ rollNumber: 1, standard: 1, createdBy: 1 }, { unique: true, sparse: true });
  ```

#### Standard Model (`/backend/models/Standard.js`)
- Removed global `unique: true` constraint from `name` field
- Added compound index for uniqueness per teacher:
  ```javascript
  standardSchema.index({ name: 1, createdBy: 1 }, { unique: true });
  ```

## Impact
- ✅ Each teacher now only sees their own students
- ✅ Each teacher can create standards with same names independently
- ✅ Roll numbers are unique per standard per teacher (not globally)
- ✅ File uploads are isolated per teacher
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing API endpoints
- ✅ All CRUD operations respect teacher ownership

## Testing
Created test script (`test-data-isolation.js`) that verifies:
- Two teachers can create standards with same names
- Students with same roll numbers can exist under different teachers
- Data queries are properly isolated per teacher

## Security Benefits
- Data privacy: Teachers cannot access other teachers' data
- Data integrity: Prevents accidental modifications to other teachers' data
- Compliance: Meets data isolation requirements for multi-tenant applications
